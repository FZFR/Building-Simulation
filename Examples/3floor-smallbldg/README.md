Area = L x W = xx m²
```

L: 7 m  
W: 6 m

Height:  
2nd floor: 3.3m  
3rd floor: 3m

* 1st condition:  
  - 2nd floor  
  **office (Open Office)**
  - 3rd floor   
  **studio**  
  Heat source: camera lighting around 500 watts, needs to convert to W/m²
  ```
  Convert to W/m²= Watts / Area
  ```  
  5peoples in the room, needs to convert to Density per square meter   
  ```
  Population Density = Number of People/Land Area.
